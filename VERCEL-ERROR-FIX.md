# ðŸš¨ VERCEL DEPLOYMENT ERROR FIX

## Error: Environment Variable "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY" references Secret "deepseek_api_key", which does not exist.

### Quick Fix Steps:

1. **Delete & Re-import Project (Recommended)**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Delete the existing StudyMate project
   - Import fresh from GitHub
   - This clears all cached configurations

2. **OR Clear Project Settings**
   - Go to Project â†’ Settings â†’ General
   - Click "Reset Project" or "Clear Build Cache"

3. **Configure Environment Variables (NOT Secrets!)**
   - Go to Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add as regular Environment Variables:

   ```
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = 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
   OPENROUTER_API_URL = https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
   REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 20
   REQUESTS_PER_DAY = 1000
   NODE_ENV = production
   MAX_TOKENS_PER_REQUEST = 32000
   ```

   **Important**: 
   - Select âœ… Production âœ… Preview âœ… Development for each
   - DO NOT use the "Secrets" section
   - DO NOT use @secret_name syntax

4. **Build Settings**
   ```
   Framework Preset: Other
   Build Command: npm run vercel-build
   Output Directory: frontend/build
   Install Command: npm install
   Root Directory: ./
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy" 
   - Should work without errors now

### Why This Error Occurred:
- Vercel's old configuration might have cached secret references
- The `vercel.json` was previously configured to use secrets instead of environment variables
- Environment variables are simpler and work better for this use case

### Verification:
After successful deployment, test:
- https://your-app.vercel.app (homepage)
- https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health (API health check)

Your app should now deploy successfully! ðŸŽ‰
